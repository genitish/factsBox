0,"One in six people are aged 10–19 years.  ,Mental health conditions account for 16% of the global burden of disease and injury in people aged 10–19 years.  ,Half of all mental health conditions start by 14 years of age but most cases are undetected and untreated (1).,Globally, depression is one of the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents. ,Suicide is the third leading cause of death in 15-19-year-olds.  ,The consequences of not addressing adolescent mental health conditions extend to adulthood, impairing both physical and mental health and limiting opportunities to lead fulfilling lives as adults.","Approximately 12 million girls aged 15–19 years and at least 777,000 girls under 15 years give birth each year in developing regions. (1) (2),At least 10 million unintended pregnancies occur each year among adolescent girls aged 15–19 years in the developing world. (1),Complications during pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death for 15–19-year-old girls globally. (3),Of the estimated 5.6 million abortions that occur each year among adolescent girls aged 15–19 years, 3.9 million are unsafe, contributing to maternal mortality, morbidity and lasting health problems.(1),Adolescent mothers (ages 10–19 years) face higher risks of eclampsia, puerperal endometritis, and systemic infections than women aged 20 to 24 years, and babies of adolescent mothers face higher risks of low birth weight, preterm delivery and severe neonatal conditions. (4)","More than 1.1 million adolescents aged 10-19 years died in 2016, over 3000 every day, mostly from preventable or treatable causes.,Road traffic injuries were the leading cause of death among adolescents in 2016. Other major causes of adolescent deaths include suicide, interpersonal violence, HIV/AIDS and diarrhoeal diseases.,Half of all mental health disorders in adulthood start by age 14, but most cases are undetected and untreated.,Globally, there are 44 births per 1000 to girls aged 15 to 19 per year.","Between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the world's population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22%.,By 2020, the number of people aged 60 years and older will outnumber children younger than 5 years.,In 2050, 80% of older people will be living in low- and middle-income countries.,The pace of population ageing is much faster than in the past.,All countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready to make the most of this demographic shift.","Worldwide, 3 million deaths every year result from harmful use of alcohol, this represent 5.3 % of all deaths.,The harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury conditions.,Overall 5.1 % of the global burden of disease and injury is attributable to alcohol, as measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).,Alcohol consumption causes death and disability relatively early in life. In the age group 20–39 years approximately 13.5 % of the total deaths are alcohol-attributable.,There is a causal relationship between harmful use of alcohol and a range of mental and behavioural disorders, other noncommunicable conditions as well as injuries.,The latest causal relationships have been established between harmful drinking and incidence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis as well as the course of HIV/AIDS.,Beyond health consequences, the harmful use of alcohol brings significant social and economic losses to individuals and society at large.","Air pollution is a major environmental risk to health. By reducing air pollution levels, countries can reduce the burden of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma.,The lower the levels of air pollution, the better the cardiovascular and respiratory health of the population will be, both long- and short-term.,The WHO Air Quality Guidelines: Global Update 2005 provide an assessment of health effects of air pollution and thresholds for health–harmful pollution levels.,In 2016, 91% of the world population was living in places where the WHO air quality guidelines levels were not met.,Ambient (outdoor air pollution) in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2016.,Some 91% of those premature deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and the greatest number in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions.,Policies and investments supporting cleaner transport, energy-efficient homes, power generation, industry and better municipal waste management would reduce key sources of outdoor air pollution.,In addition to outdoor air pollution, indoor smoke is a serious health risk for some 3 billion people who cook and heat their homes with biomass, kerosene fuels and coal.","Animal bites are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.,Worldwide, up to five million people are bitten by snakes every year; the majority in Africa and South-East Asia.,Prompt medical treatment with appropriate antivenom is required for poisonous snake bites.,Dog bites account for tens of millions of injuries annually; the highest risk is among children.,Rabies is a significant health concern following dog bites, cat bites and monkey bites.","Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.,Antibiotic resistance can affect anyone, of any age, in any country.,Antibiotic resistance occurs naturally, but misuse of antibiotics in humans and animals is accelerating the process.,A growing number of infections – such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea, and salmonellosis – are becoming harder to treat as the antibiotics used to treat them become less effective.,Antibiotic resistance leads to longer hospital stays, higher medical costs and increased mortality.","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi.,AMR is an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across all government sectors and society.,Without effective antibiotics, the success of major surgery and cancer chemotherapy would be compromised.,The cost of health care for patients with resistant infections is higher than care for patients with non-resistant infections due to longer duration of illness, additional tests and use of more expensive drugs.,In 2016, 490 000 people developed multi-drug resistant TB globally, and drug resistance is starting to complicate the fight against HIV and malaria, as well.","Arsenic is naturally present at high levels in the groundwater of a number of countries.,Arsenic is highly toxic in its inorganic form.,Contaminated water used for drinking, food preparation and irrigation of food crops poses the greatest threat to public health from arsenic.,Long-term exposure to arsenic from drinking-water and food can cause cancer and skin lesions. It has also been associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In utero and early childhood exposure has been linked to negative impacts on cognitive development and increased deaths in young adults.,The most important action in affected communities is the prevention of further exposure to arsenic by provision of a safe water supply.","About 125 million people in the world are exposed to asbestos at the workplace.,All forms of asbestos, including chrysotile, are carcinogenic to humans.","Assistive technology is an umbrella term covering the systems and services related to the delivery of assistive products and services.,Assistive products maintain or improve an individual’s functioning and independence, thereby promoting their well-being.,Hearing aids, wheelchairs, communication aids, spectacles, prostheses, pill organizers and memory aids are all examples of assistive products.,Globally, more than 1 billion people need 1 or more assistive products.,With an ageing global population and a rise in noncommunicable diseases, more than 2 billion people will need at least 1 assistive product by 2030, with many older people needing 2 or more.,Today, only 1 in 10 people in need have access to assistive products.","Asthma is one of the major noncommunicable diseases. It is a chronic disease of the air passages of the lungs which inflames and narrows them.,It was estimated that more than 339 million people had Asthma globally in 2016. (1) It is a common disease among children.,Most asthma-related deaths occur in low- and lower-middle income countries.,According to WHO estimates, there were 417,918 deaths due to asthma at the global level and 24.8 million DALYS attributable to Asthma in in 2016. (2, 3),The strongest risk factors for developing asthma are inhaled substances and particles that may provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways.,Medication can control asthma. Avoiding asthma triggers can also reduce the severity of asthma.,Appropriate management of asthma can enable people to enjoy a good quality of life.","One in 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)(1).,ASDs begin in childhood and tend to persist into adolescence and adulthood.,While some people with ASD can live independently, others have severe disabilities and require life-long care and support.,Evidence-based psychosocial interventions, such as behavioural treatment and parent skills training programmes, can reduce difficulties in communication and social behaviour, with a positive impact on well-being and quality of life for persons with ASD and their caregivers.,Interventions for people with ASD need to be accompanied by broader actions for making physical, social and attitudinal environments more accessible, inclusive and supportive.,Worldwide, people with ASD are often subject to stigma, discrimination and human rights violations. Globally, access to services and support for people with ASD is inadequate.","Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed.,This 1 billion people includes those with moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness due to unaddressed refractive error, as well as near vision impairment caused by unaddressed presbyopia.,Globally, the leading causes of vision impairment are uncorrected refractive errors and cataracts.,The majority of people with vision impairment are over the age of 50 years. ","Of the 118.5 million blood donations collected globally, 40% of these are collected in high-income countries, home to 16% of the world’s population.,In low-income countries, up to 54 % of blood transfusions are given to children under 5 years of age; whereas in high-income countries, the most frequently transfused patient group is over 60 years of age, accounting for up to 75% of all transfusions.,Based on samples of 1000 people, the blood donation rate is 31.5 donations in high-income countries, 15.9 donations in upper-middle-income countries, 6.8 donations in lower-middle-income countries and 5.0 donations in low-income countries.,An increase of 7.8 million blood donations from voluntary unpaid donors has been reported from 2013 to 2018. In total, 79 countries collect over 90% of their blood supply from voluntary unpaid blood donors; however, 56 countries collect more than 50% of their blood supply from family/replacement or paid donors.,Only 55 of 171 reporting countries produce plasma-derived medicinal products (PDMP) through the fractionation of plasma collected in the reporting country. A total of 90 countries reported that all PDMP are imported, 16 countries reported that no PDMP were used during the reporting period, and 10 countries did not respond to the question.","Clostridium botulinum is a bacterium that produces dangerous toxins (botulinum toxins) under low-oxygen conditions.,Botulinum toxins are one of the most lethal substances known.,Botulinum toxins block nerve functions and can lead to respiratory and muscular paralysis.,Human botulism may refer to foodborne botulism, infant botulism, wound botulism, and inhalation botulism or other types of intoxication.,Foodborne botulism, caused by consumption of improperly processed food, is a rare but potentially fatal disease if not diagnosed rapidly and treated with antitoxin.,Homemade canned, preserved or fermented foodstuffs are a common source of foodborne botulism and their preparation requires extra caution.","An estimated 180 000 deaths every year are caused by burns – the vast majority occur in low- and middle-income countries.,Non-fatal burn injuries are a leading cause of morbidity.,Burns occur mainly in the home and workplace.,Burns are preventable.","Buruli ulcer is a chronic debilitating disease caused by an environmental Mycobacterium ulcerans.,It often affects the skin and sometimes bone and can lead to permanent disfigurement and long-term disability.,At least 33 countries with tropical, subtropical and temperate climates have reported Buruli ulcer in Africa, South America and Western Pacific regions.,The mode of transmission is not known and there is no prevention for the disease.","Campylobacter is 1 of 4 key global causes of diarrhoeal diseases. It is considered to be the most common bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis in the world.,Campylobacter infections are generally mild, but can be fatal among very young children, elderly, and immunosuppressed individuals.,Campylobacter species can be killed by heat and thoroughly cooking food.,To prevent Campylobacter infections, make sure to follow basic food hygiene practices when preparing food.","Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and is responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer.,Approximately 70% of deaths from cancer occur in low- and middle-income countries.,Around one third of deaths from cancer are due to the 5 leading behavioral and dietary risks: high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol use.,Tobacco use is the most important risk factor for cancer and is responsible for approximately 22% of cancer deaths (2).,Cancer causing infections, such as hepatitis and human papilloma virus (HPV), are responsible for up to 25% of cancer cases in low- and middle-income countries (3).,Late-stage presentation and inaccessible diagnosis and treatment are common. In 2017, only 26% of low-income countries reported having pathology services generally available in the public sector. More than 90% of high-income countries reported treatment services are available compared to less than 30% of low-income countries.,The economic impact of cancer is significant and is increasing. The total annual economic cost of cancer in 2010 was estimated at approximately US$ 1.16 trillion (4).,Only 1 in 5 low- and middle-income countries have the necessary data to drive cancer policy (5).","Cancer is a leading cause of death for children and adolescents around the world and approximately 300,000 children aged 0 to 19 years old are diagnosed with cancer each year. [1],The most common categories of childhood cancers include leukemias, brain cancers, lymphomas and solid tumours, such as neuroblastoma and Wilms tumour. [1-2],In high-income countries more than 80% of children with cancer are cured, but in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) only about 20% are cured. [2-3],Childhood cancer generally cannot be prevented or screened.,Improving outcomes for children with cancer requires early and accurate diagnosis followed by effective treatment.,Most childhood cancers can be cured with generic medicines and other forms of treatments including surgery and radiotherapy. Treatment of childhood cancer can be cost-effective in all income settings. [2],Avoidable deaths from childhood cancers in LMICs result from lack of diagnosis, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, obstacles to accessing care, abandonment of treatment, death from toxicity, and higher rates of relapse.,Childhood cancer data systems are needed to drive continuous improvements in the quality of care, and to drive policy decisions.","CVDs are the number 1 cause of death globally: more people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause.,An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart attack and stroke.,Over three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries.,Out of the 17 million premature deaths (under the age of 70) due to noncommunicable diseases in 2015, 82% are in low- and middle-income countries, and 37% are caused by CVDs.,Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.,People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management using counselling and medicines, as appropriate.","About 6 million to 7 million people worldwide, mostly in Latin America, are estimated to be infected with Trypansosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease.,The main route of transmission (vector-borne transmission) has occurred in Latin America through the insect called triatomine bug, which can carry the Trypanosoma cruzi.,Other routes of transmission include: oral (food-borne) transmission, blood/blood products transfusion, mother-to-child (congenital) and organ transplantation transmissions or even laboratory accident transmission.,Chagas disease was once entirely confined to the Region of the Americas – principally Latin America – but in the last decades, due to population movements, most infected people live in urban settings (urbanization) and the disease has spread to other continents.,Trypanosoma cruzi infection is curable if treatment is initiated soon after infection.,In chronic patients, antiparasitic treatment can potentially prevent or curb disease progression and prevent tranmission, for instance, mother-to-child infection.,Up to 30% of chronically infected people develop cardiac alterations and up to 10% develop digestive, neurological or mixed alterations which may require specific treatment.,Vector control is the most useful method to prevent Chagas disease in Latin America.,Blood screening is vital to prevent infection through transfusion and organ transplantation.,Detection and treatment of girls and women of child-bearing with infection is essential, together with the screening of newborns and siblings of infected mothers without previous antiparasitic treatment.,Chagas disease is a complex socio-economic, environmental (multidimensional) health problem and its different dimensions linked in a gearing mechanism justify the necessity of multi-sectorial approaches.","Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash.,Joint pain is often debilitating and can vary in duration.,The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue and zika, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where they are common.,There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms.,The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya.,The disease mostly occurs in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. However a major outbreak in 2015 affected several countries of the Region of the Americas.","Nearly 3 in 4 children - or 300 million children - aged 2–4 years regularly suffer physical punishment and/or psychological violence at the hands of parents and caregivers,One in 5 women and 1 in 13 men report having been sexually abused as a child aged 0-17 years.,120 million girls and young women under 20 years of age have suffered some form of forced sexual contact.,Consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and the social and occupational outcomes can ultimately slow a country's economic and social development.,A child who is abused is more likely to abuse others as an adult so that violence is passed down from one generation to the next. It is therefore critical to break this cycle of violence, and in so doing create positive multi-generational impacts.,Preventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible and requires a multisectoral approach.,Effective prevention approaches include supporting parents and teaching positive parenting skills, and enhancing laws to prohibit violent punishment.,Ongoing care of children and families can reduce the risk of maltreatment reoccurring and can minimize its consequences.","In 2018 an estimated 6.2 million children and adolescents under the age of 15 years died, mostly from preventable causes. Of these deaths, 5.3 million occurred in the first 5 years, with almost half of these in the first month of life.,Leading causes of death in children under-5 years are preterm birth complications, pneumonia, birth asphyxia, congenital anomalies, diarrhoea and malaria. Nearly half of these deaths are in newborns.,More than half of these early child deaths are preventable or can be treated with simple, affordable interventions including immunization, adequate nutrition, safe water and food and appropriate care by a trained health provider when needed.,Children in sub-Saharan Africa are more than 15 times more likely to die before the age of 5 than children in high income countries.","Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease that can kill within hours if left untreated.,Researchers have estimated that each year there are 1.3 million to 4.0 million cases of cholera, and 21 000 to 143 000 deaths worldwide due to cholera (1).,Up to 80% of cases can be successfully treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS).,Severe cases will need rapid treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics.,Provision of safe water and sanitation is critical to control the transmission of cholera and other waterborne diseases.,Safe oral cholera vaccines should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in areas known to be high risk for cholera.,A global strategy on cholera control with a target to reduce cholera deaths by 90% was launched in 2017.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive life­threatening lung disease that causes breathlessness (initially with exertion) and predisposes to exacerbations and serious illness.,The Global Burden of Disease Study reports a prevalence of 251 million cases of COPD globally in 2016.,Globally, it is estimated that 3.17 million deaths were caused by the disease in 2015 (that is, 5% of all deaths globally in that year).,More than 90% of COPD deaths occur in low­ and middle­income countries.,The primary cause of COPD is exposure to tobacco smoke (either active smoking or second­hand smoke).,Other risk factors include exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution and occupational dusts and fumes.,Exposure to indoor air pollution can affect the unborn child and represent a risk factor for developing COPD later in life.,Some cases of COPD are due to long-term asthma.,COPD is likely to increase in coming years due to higher smoking prevalence and aging populations in many countries.,Many cases of COPD are preventable by avoidance or early cessation of smoking. Hence, it is important that countries adopt the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO-FCTC) and implement the MPOWER package of measures so that non-smoking becomes the norm globally.,COPD is not curable, but treatment can relieve symptoms, improve quality of life and reduce the risk of death.","Globally, two-thirds (38 million) of 56 million annual deaths are still not registered.,Almost half of the world’s children go unregistered.,Many barriers prevent people from registering births and deaths.","Climate change affects the social and environmental determinants of health – clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter.,Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress.,The direct damage costs to health (i.e. excluding costs in health-determining sectors such as agriculture and water and sanitation), is estimated to be between USD 2-4 billion/year by 2030.,Areas with weak health infrastructure – mostly in developing countries – will be the least able to cope without assistance to prepare and respond.,Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases through better transport, food and energy-use choices can result in improved health, particularly through reduced air pollution.","Community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes are usually voluntary and characterized by community members pooling funds to offset the cost of healthcare.,Despite much hope in these systems, evidence suggests the impact of CBHI on financial protection and access to needed health care are moderate for those enrolled.,Most CBHI schemes have low participation levels and the poorest people usually remain excluded.,Theory and practice show that CBHIs play only a limited role in helping countries move towards universal health care (UHC).,However, they can have other positive impacts such as community development and local accountability of health care providers.","An estimated 303 000 newborns die within 4 weeks of birth every year, worldwide, due to congenital anomalies.,Congenital anomalies can contribute to long-term disability, which may have significant impacts on individuals, families, health-care systems, and societies.,The most common, severe congenital anomalies are heart defects, neural tube defects and Down syndrome.,Although congenital anomalies may be the result of one or more genetic, infectious, nutritional or environmental factors, it is often difficult to identify the exact causes.,Some congenital anomalies can be prevented. Vaccination, adequate intake of folic acid or iodine through fortification of staple foods or supplementation, and adequate antenatal care are just 3 examples of prevention methods.","The Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks.,CCHF outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 40%.,The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.,CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north.,There is no vaccine available for either people or animals.","Around 466 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss (1), and 34 million of these are children.,It is estimated that by 2050 over 900 million people will have disabling hearing loss.,Hearing loss may result from genetic causes, complications at birth, certain infectious diseases, chronic ear infections, the use of particular drugs, exposure to excessive noise, and ageing.,60% of childhood hearing loss is due to preventable causes.,1.1 billion young people (aged between 12–35 years) are at risk of hearing loss due to exposure to noise in recreational settings.,Unaddressed hearing loss poses an annual global cost of US$ 750 billion. Interventions to prevent, identify and address hearing loss are cost-effective and can bring great benefit to individuals.,People with hearing loss benefit from early identification; use of hearing aids, cochlear implants and other assistive devices; captioning and sign language; and other forms of educational and social support.,Current estimates suggest an 83% gap in hearing aid need and use, i.e., only 17% of those who could benefit from use of a hearing aid actually use one.","Dementia is a syndrome in which there is deterioration in memory, thinking, behaviour and the ability to perform everyday activities.,Although dementia mainly affects older people, it is not a normal part of ageing.,Worldwide, around 50 million people have dementia, and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year.,Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 60–70% of cases.,Dementia is one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people worldwide.,Dementia has a physical, psychological, social, and economic impact, not only on people with dementia, but also on their carers, families and society at large.","Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection.,The virus responsible for causing dengue, is called dengue virus (DENV). There are four DENV serotypes, meaning that it is possible to be infected four times.,While many DENV infections produce only mild illness, DENV can cause an acute flu-like illness. Occasionally this develops into a potentially lethal complication, called severe dengue.,Severe dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death in some Asian and Latin American countries. It requires management by medical professionals.,There is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue. Early detection of disease progression associated with severe dengue, and access to proper medical care lowers fatality rates of severe dengue to below 1%.,Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.,The global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades. About half of the world's population is now at risk. There are an estimated 100-400 million infections each year.,Dengue prevention and control depends on effective vector control measures. Sustained community involvement can improve vector control efforts substantially.","Depression is a common mental disorder. Globally, more than 264 million people of all ages suffer from depression.,Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease.,More women are affected by depression than men.,Depression can lead to suicide.,There are effective psychological and pharmacological treatments for moderate and severe depression.","The number of people with diabetes rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014.,The global prevalence of diabetes* among adults over 18 years of age rose from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014 (1).,Between 2000 and 2016, there was a 5% increase in premature mortality from diabetes.,Diabetes prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.,Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.,In 2016, an estimated 1.6 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes. Another 2.2 million deaths were attributable to high blood glucose in 2012.,Almost half of all deaths attributable to high blood glucose occur before the age of 70 years. WHO estimates that diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in 2016.,A healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.,Diabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet, physical activity, medication and regular screening and treatment for complications.","Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old. It is both preventable and treatable.,Each year diarrhoea kills around 525 000 children under five.,A significant proportion of diarrhoeal disease can be prevented through safe drinking-water and adequate sanitation and hygiene.,Globally, there are nearly 1.7 billion cases of childhood diarrhoeal disease every year.,Diarrhoea is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under five years old.","Dioxins are a group of chemically-related compounds that are persistent environmental pollutants (POPs).,Dioxins are found throughout the world in the environment and they accumulate in the food chain, mainly in the fatty tissue of animals.,More than 90% of human exposure is through food, mainly meat and dairy products, fish and shellfish. Many national authorities have programmes in place to monitor the food supply.,Dioxins are highly toxic and can cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and also cause cancer.,Due to the omnipresence of dioxins, all people have background exposure, which is not expected to affect human health. However, due to the highly toxic potential, efforts need to be undertaken to reduce current background exposure.,Prevention or reduction of human exposure is best done via source-directed measures, i.e. strict control of industrial processes to reduce formation of dioxins.","Over a billion people, about 15% of the world's population, have some form of disability.,Between 110 million and 190 million adults have significant difficulties in functioning.,Rates of disability are increasing due to population ageing and increases in chronic health conditions, among other causes.,People with disability have less access to health care services and therefore experience unmet health care needs.","Dracunculiasis is a crippling parasitic disease on the verge of eradication, with 54 human cases reported in 2019.,From the time infection occurs, it takes between 10–14 months for the transmission cycle to complete until a mature worm emerges from the body.,The parasite is transmitted mostly  when people drink stagnant water contaminated with parasite-infected water fleas.,Dracunculiasis was endemic in 20 countries in the mid-1980s.,The total of 54 cases in 2019 were reported from four countries: Angola (1 case), Chad (48 cases), South Sudan (4 cases) and Cameroon (1 case, likely imported from Chad).","In 2017, 71% of the global population (5.3 billion people) used a safely managed drinking-water service – that is, one located on premises, available when needed, and free from contamination.,90% of the global population (6.8 billion people) used at least a basic service. A basic service is an improved drinking-water source within a round trip of 30 minutes to collect water.,785 million people lack even a basic drinking-water service, including 144 million people who are dependent on surface water.,Globally, at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces.,Contaminated water can transmit diseases such diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio. Contaminated drinking water is estimated to cause 485 000 diarrhoeal deaths each year.,By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas.,In least developed countries, 22% of health care facilities have no water service, 21% no sanitation service, and 22% no waste management service.","Drowning is the 3rd leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury-related deaths.,There are an estimated 320 000 annual drowning deaths worldwide.,Global estimates may significantly underestimate the actual public health problem related to drowning.,Children, males and individuals with increased access to water are most at risk of drowning.","Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a bacteria that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. Most E.coli strains are harmless, but some can cause serious food poisoning.,Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) is a bacterium that can cause severe foodborne disease.,Primary sources of STEC outbreaks are raw or undercooked ground meat products, raw milk, and faecal contamination of vegetables.,In most cases, the illness is self-limiting, but it may lead to a life-threatening disease including haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), especially in young children and the elderly.,STEC is heat-sensitive. In preparing food at home, be sure to follow basic food hygiene practices such as ""cook thoroughly"".,Following the WHO “Five keys to safer food” is a key measure to prevent infections with foodborne pathogens such as STEC.","Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a rare but severe, often fatal illness in humans.,The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission.,The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.,Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks.,Good outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, namely case management, infection prevention and control practices, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, safe and dignified burials and social mobilisation.,Vaccines to protect against Ebola are under development and have been used to help control the spread of Ebola outbreaks in Guinea and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).,Early supportive care with rehydration, symptomatic treatment improves survival. There is no licensed treatment proven to neutralize the virus but a range of blood, immunological and drug therapies are under development.,Pregnant and breastfeeding women with Ebola should be offered early supportive care. Likewise vaccine prevention and experimental treatment should be offered under the same conditions as for non-pregnant population.","Human echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus.,The two most important forms in humans are cystic echinococcosis (hydatidosis) and alveolar echinococcosis.,Humans are infected through ingestion of parasite eggs in contaminated food, water or soil, or after direct contact with animal hosts.,Echinococcosis is often expensive and complicated to treat and may require extensive surgery and/or prolonged drug therapy.,Prevention programmes focus on deworming of dogs, which are the definitive hosts. In the case of cystic echinococcosis preventive measures also include, deworming dogs, slauhterhouse hygiene, and public education.,More than 1 million people are affected with echinococcosis at any one time.","Around 1 in 6 people 60 years and older experienced some form of abuse in community settings during the past year.,Rates of elder abuse are high in institutions such as nursing homes and long-term care facilities, with 2 in 3 staff reporting that they have committed abuse in the past year.,Elder abuse can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences.,Elder abuse is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations.,The global population of people aged 60 years and older will more than double, from 900 million in 2015 to about 2 billion in 2050.","Mobile phone use is ubiquitous with an estimated 6.9 billion subscriptions globally,The electromagnetic fields produced by mobile phones are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as possibly carcinogenic to humans.,Studies are ongoing to more fully assess potential long-term effects of mobile phone use.,WHO will conduct a formal risk assessment of all studied health outcomes from radiofrequency fields exposure by 2016.","Emergency contraception (EC) can prevent up to over 95% of pregnancies when taken within 5 days after intercourse.,EC can be used in the following situations: unprotected intercourse, concerns about possible contraceptive failure, incorrect use of contraceptives, and sexual assault if without contraception coverage.,Methods of emergency contraception are the copper-bearing intrauterine devices (IUDs) and the emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs).,A copper-bearing IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception available.,The emergency contraceptive pill regimens recommended by WHO are ulipristal acetate, levonorgestrel, or combined oral contraceptives (COCs) consisting of ethinyl estradiol plus levonorgestrel.","Epilepsy is a chronic noncommunicable disease of the brain that affects people of all ages.,Around 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, making it one of the most common neurological diseases globally.,Nearly 80% of people with epilepsy live in low- and middle-income countries.,It is estimated that up to 70% of people living with epilepsy could live seizure- free if properly diagnosed and treated.,The risk of premature death in people with epilepsy is up to three times higher than for the general population.,Three quarters of people with epilepsy living in low-income countries do not get the treatment they need.,In many parts of the world, people with epilepsy and their families suffer from stigma and discrimination.","Falls are the second leading cause of accidental or unintentional injury deaths worldwide.,Each year an estimated 646 000 individuals die from falls globally of which over 80% are in low- and middle-income countries.,Adults older than 65 years of age suffer the greatest number of fatal falls.,37.3 million falls that are severe enough to require medical attention occur each year.,Prevention strategies should emphasize education, training, creating safer environments, prioritizing fall-related research and establishing effective policies to reduce risk.","Among the 1.9 billion Women of Reproductive Age group (15-49 years) worldwide in 2019, 1.1 billion have a need for family planning; of these, 842 million are using contraceptive methods, and 270 million have an unmet need for contraception [1,2],The proportion of the need for family planning satisfied by modern methods, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicator 3.7.1, was 75.7% globally in 2019, yet less than half of the need for family planning was met in Middle and Western Africa [1],Only one contraceptive method, condoms, can prevent both a pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.,Use of contraception advances the human right of people to determine the number and spacing of their children.","Female genital mutilation (FGM) involves the partial or total removal of external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.,The practice has no health benefits for girls and women.,FGM can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, as well as complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths.,More than 200 million girls and women alive today have been cut in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia where FGM is concentrated (1).,FGM is mostly carried out on young girls between infancy and age 15.,FGM is a violation of the human rights of girls and women.,WHO is opposed to all forms of FGM, and is opposed to health care providers performing FGM (medicalization of FGM).,Treatment of health complications of FGM in 27 high prevalence countries costs 1.4 billion USD per year.","Food additives are substances added to food to maintain or improve its safety, freshness, taste, texture, or appearance.,Food additives need to be checked for potential harmful effects on human health before they can be used.,The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), is the international body responsible for evaluating the safety of food additives.,Only food additives that have been evaluated and deemed safe by JECFA, on the basis of which maximum use levels have been established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, can be used in foods that are traded internationally.","Access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food is key to sustaining life and promoting good health.,Unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances, causes more than 200 diseases – ranging from diarrhoea to cancers.,An estimated 600 million – almost 1 in 10 people in the world – fall ill after eating contaminated food and 420 000 die every year, resulting in the loss of 33 million healthy life years (DALYs).,US$110 billion is lost each year in productivity and medical expenses resulting from unsafe food in low- and middle-income countries.,Children under 5 years of age carry 40% of the foodborne disease burden, with 125 000 deaths every year.,Diarrhoeal diseases are the most common illnesses resulting from the consumption of contaminated food, causing 550 million people to fall ill and 230 000 deaths every year.,Food safety, nutrition and food security are inextricably linked. Unsafe food creates a vicious cycle of disease and malnutrition, particularly affecting infants, young children, elderly and the sick.,Foodborne diseases impede socioeconomic development by straining health care systems, and harming national economies, tourism and trade.,Food supply chains now cross multiple national borders. Good collaboration between governments, producers and consumers helps ensure food safety.","Foodborne trematodiases cause 2 million life years lost to disability and death worldwide every year.,People become infected by eating raw fish, crustaceans or vegetables that harbour the parasite larvae.,Foodborne trematodiases are most prevalent in East Asia and South America.,Foodborne trematodiases result in severe liver and lung disease.,Safe and efficacious medicines are available to prevent and treat foodborne trematodiases.,Prevention and management of food-borne trematodes requires cross-sectoral collaboration on the human-animal and ecosystems interface.","Sufficient financial resources for the government to finance the exempted services are crucial for FHC policies to contribute towards universal health coverage.,Free health care (FHC) policies have gained popularity over the past 10 years, mostly in western Africa.,FHC policies remove formal user fees at the point of service.  They can apply to everyone for all health services, or to a selection of specific population groups or services,While FHC policies may trigger an increase in the use of services, evidence on improved financial protection is mixed.,Without proper targeting and monitoring, better-off population groups will benefit from FHC policies more than vulnerable population groups.","Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare condition in which a person’s immune system attacks the peripheral nerves.,People of all ages can be affected, but it is more common in adults and in males.,Most people recover fully from even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome.,Severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome are rare, but can result in near-total paralysis.,Guillain-Barré syndrome is potentially life-threatening. People with Guillain-Barré syndrome should be treated and monitored; some may need intensive care. Treatment includes supportive care and some immunological therapies.","Headache disorders are among the most common disorders of the nervous system.,It has been estimated that almost half of the adult population have had a headache at least once within the last year.,Headache disorders, which are characterized by recurrent headache, are associated with personal and societal burdens of pain, disability, damaged quality of life, and financial cost.,Worldwide, a minority of people with headache disorders are diagnosed appropriately by a health-care provider.,Headache has been underestimated, under-recognized and under-treated throughout the world.","Of the total amount of waste generated by health-care activities, about 85% is general, non-hazardous waste.,The remaining 15% is considered hazardous material that may be infectious, toxic or radioactive.,Every year an estimated 16 billion injections are administered worldwide, but not all of the needles and syringes are properly disposed of afterwards.,Open burning and incineration of health care wastes can, under some circumstances, result in the emission of dioxins, furans, and particulate matter.,Measures to ensure the safe and environmentally sound management of health care wastes can prevent adverse health and environmental impacts from such waste including the unintended release of chemical or biological hazards, including drug-resistant microorganisms, into the environment thus protecting the health of patients, health workers, and the general public.","A healthy diet helps to protect against malnutrition in all its forms, as well as noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including  such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.,Unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity are leading global risks to health.,Healthy dietary practices start early in life – breastfeeding fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development, and may have longer term health benefits such as reducing the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life.,Energy intake (calories) should be in balance with energy expenditure. To avoid unhealthy weight gain, total fat should not exceed 30% of total energy intake (1, 2, 3). Intake of saturated fats should be less than 10% of total energy intake, and intake of trans-fats less than 1% of total energy intake, with a shift in fat consumption away from saturated fats and trans-fats to unsaturated fats (3), and towards the goal of eliminating industrially-produced trans-fats (4, 5, 6).,Limiting intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake (2, 7) is part of a healthy diet. A further reduction to less than 5% of total energy intake is suggested for additional health benefits (7).,Keeping salt intake to less than 5 g per day  (equivalent to sodium intake of less than 2 g per day) helps to prevent hypertension, and reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke in the adult population (8).,WHO Member States have agreed to reduce the global population’s intake of salt by 30% by 2025; they have also agreed to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity in adults and adolescents as well as in childhood overweight by 2025 (9, 10).","Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe illness.,The hepatitis A virus (HAV) is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food and water or through direct contact with an infectious person.,Almost everyone recovers fully from hepatitis A with a lifelong immunity. However, a very small proportion of people infected with hepatitis A could die from fulminant hepatitis.,WHO estimates that hepatitis A caused approximately 7 134 deaths in 2016 (accounting for 0.5% of the mortality due to viral hepatitis).,The risk of hepatitis A infection is associated with a lack of safe water, and poor sanitation and hygiene (such as dirty hands).,In countries where the risk of infection from food or water is low, there are outbreaks among men who have sex with men (MSM) and persons who inject drugs (PWIDs).,Epidemics can be prolonged and cause substantial economic loss.,A safe and effective vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis A.,Safe water supply, food safety, improved sanitation, hand washing and the hepatitis A vaccine are the most effective ways to combat the disease. Persons at high risk, such as travelers to countries with high levels of infection, MSM and PWIDs can get vaccinated.","Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease.,The virus is most commonly transmitted from mother to child during birth and delivery, as well as through contact with blood or other body fluids.,WHO estimates that in 2015, 257 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen positive).,In 2015, hepatitis B resulted in an estimated 887 000 deaths, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (i.e. primary liver cancer).,As of 2016, 27 million people (10.5% of all people estimated to be living with hepatitis B) were aware of their infection, while 4.5 million (16.7%) of the people diagnosed were on treatment.,Hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccines that are safe, available and effective.","Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV): the virus can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis, ranging in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness.,Hepatitis C is a major cause of liver cancer.,The hepatitis C virus is a bloodborne virus: the most common modes of infection are through exposure to small quantities of blood. This may happen through injection drug use, unsafe injection practices, unsafe health care, transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products, and sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood.,Globally, an estimated 71 million people have chronic hepatitis C virus infection. ,A significant number of those who are chronically infected will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer.,WHO estimated that in 2016, approximately 399 000 people died from hepatitis C, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer).,Antiviral medicines can cure more than 95% of persons with hepatitis C infection, thereby reducing the risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer, but access to diagnosis and treatment is low.,There is currently no effective vaccine against hepatitis C; however, research in this area is ongoing.","Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a virus that requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its replication. HDV infection occurs only simultaneously or as super-infection with HBV.,The virus is most commonly transmitted from mother to child during birth and delivery, as well as through contact with blood or other body fluids.,Vertical transmission from mother to child is rare.,Hepatitis D virus (HDV) affects globally nearly 5% of people who have a chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV).,Several geographical hotspots of high prevalence of HDV infection exist, including Mongolia, the Republic of Moldova, and countries in Western and Middle Africa.,Populations that are more likely to have HBV and HDV co-infection include people who inject drugs, indigenous populations and recipients of hemodialysis.,Worldwide, the overall number of HDV infection has decreased since 1980s. This trend is mainly due to a successful global HBV vaccination programme.,HDV-HBV co-infection is considered the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis due to more rapid progression towards liver-related death and hepatocellular carcinoma.,Currently, treatment success rates are generally low.,Hepatitis D infection can be prevented by hepatitis B immunization.","Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by infection with a virus known as hepatitis E virus (HEV).,Every year, there are an estimated 20 million HEV infections worldwide, leading to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis E (1).,WHO estimates that hepatitis E caused approximately 44 000 deaths in 2015 (accounting for 3.3% of the mortality due to viral hepatitis).,The virus is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, principally via contaminated water.,Hepatitis E is found worldwide, but the disease is most common in East and South Asia.,A vaccine to prevent hepatitis E virus infection has been developed and is licensed in China, but is not yet available elsewhere.","The herpes simplex virus is categorized into 2 types: herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).,HSV-1 is mainly transmitted by oral-to-oral contact to cause oral herpes (which can include symptoms known as “cold sores”), but can also cause genital herpes.,HSV-2 is a sexually transmitted infection that causes genital herpes.,Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections are lifelong.,An estimated 3.7 billion people under age 50 (67%) have HSV-1 infection globally.,An estimated 491 million people aged 15-49 (13%) worldwide have HSV-2 infection.,Most oral and genital herpes infections are asymptomatic.,Symptoms of herpes include painful blisters or ulcers at the site of infection.,Herpes infections are most contagious when symptoms are present but can still be transmitted to others in the absence of symptoms.,Infection with HSV-2 increases the risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection.","HIV continues to be a major global public health issue, having claimed almost 33 million lives so far. However, with increasing access to effective HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care, including for opportunistic infections, HIV infection has become a manageable chronic health condition, enabling people living with HIV to lead long and healthy lives.,There were an estimated 38.0 million people living with HIV at the end of 2019.,As a result of concerted international efforts to respond to HIV, coverage of services has been steadily increasing. In 2019, 68% of adults and 53% of children living with HIV globally were receiving lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART).,A great majority (85%) of pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV also received ART, which not only protects their health, but also ensures prevention of HIV transmission to their newborns.,However, not everyone is able to access HIV testing, treatment and care.  Notably, the 2018 Super-Fast-Track targets for reducing new paediatric HIV infections to 40 000 was not achieved. Global targets for 2020 are at risk of being missed unless rapid action is taken.,Due to gaps in HIV services, 690 000 people died from HIV-related causes in 2019 and 1.7 million people were newly infected.,Key population groups and their sexual partners accounted for over 60% of all new HIV infections globally among the age group 15-49 years (an estimated 62%) in 2019. In eastern European and central Asia, Asia and the Pacific, western and central Europe and north America and Middle East and north Africa, these groups accounted for over 95% of new HIV infections in each of these regions.,WHO defines key populations as people in populations who are at increased HIV risk in all countries and regions. Key populations include: men who have sex with men; people who inject drugs; people in prisons and other closed settings; sex workers and their clients; and transgender people.,In addition, given their life circumstances, a range of other populations may be particularly vulnerable, and at increased risk of HIV infection, such as adolescent girls and young women in southern and eastern Africa and indigenous peoples in some communities.,Increased HIV vulnerability is often associated with legal and social factors, which increases exposure to risk situations and creates barriers to accessing effective, quality and affordable HIV prevention, testing and treatment services.,Over two thirds of all people living with HIV live in the WHO African Region (25.7 million). While HIV is prevalent among the general population in this region, an increasing number of new infections occur among key population groups.,HIV can be diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests that can provide same-day results. HIV self-tests are increasingly available and provide an effective and acceptable alternative way to increase access to people who are not reached for HIV testing through facility-based services. Rapid test and self-tests have greatly facilitated diagnosis and linkage with treatment and care.,There is no cure for HIV infection. However, effective antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) can control the virus and help prevent onward transmission to other people.,At the end of 2019, an estimated 81% of people living with HIV knew their status. 67% were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 59% had achieved suppression of the HIV virus with no risk of infecting others.,At the end of 2019, 25.4 million people were accessing antiretroviral therapy.,Between 2000 and 2019, new HIV infections fell by 39% and HIV-related deaths fell by 51%, with 15.3 million lives saved due to ART. This achievement was the result of great efforts by national HIV programmes supported by civil society and international development partners.","Around 3 billion people cook using polluting open fires or simple stoves fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal.,Each year, close to 4 million people die prematurely from illness attributable to household air pollution from inefficient cooking practices using polluting stoves paired with solid fuels and kerosene.,Household air pollution causes noncommunicable diseases including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer.,Close to half of deaths due to pneumonia among children under 5 years of age are caused by particulate matter (soot) inhaled from household air pollution.","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of viruses that are extremely common worldwide.,There are more than 100 types of HPV, of which at least 14 are cancer-causing (also known as high risk type).,HPV is mainly transmitted through sexual contact and most people are infected with HPV shortly after the onset of sexual activity.,Cervical cancer is caused by sexually acquired infection with certain types of HPV.,Two HPV types (16 and 18) cause 70% of cervical cancers and pre-cancerous cervical lesions.,There is also evidence linking HPV with cancers of the anus, vulva, vagina, penis and oropharynx.,Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women living in less developed regions with an estimated 570 000 new cases (1) in 2018 (84% of the new cases worldwide).,In 2018, approximately 311 000 women died from cervical cancer; more than 85% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries.,Comprehensive cervical cancer control includes primary prevention (vaccination against HPV), secondary prevention (screening and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions), tertiary prevention (diagnosis and treatment of invasive cervical cancer) and palliative care.,Vaccines that protect against HPV 16 and 18 are recommended by WHO and have been approved for use in many countries.,Screening and treatment of pre-cancer lesions in women of 30 years and more is a cost-effective way to prevent cervical cancer.,Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance have shown that HPV vaccines are very safe and very effective in preventing infections with HPV infections.,Cervical cancer can be cured if diagnosed at an early stage.","The WHO Constitution (1946) envisages “…the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being.”,Understanding health as a human right creates a legal obligation on states to ensure access to timely, acceptable, and affordable health care of appropriate quality as well as to providing for the underlying determinants of health, such as safe and potable water, sanitation, food, housing, health-related information and education, and gender equality.,A States’ obligation to support the right to health – including through the allocation of “maximum available resources” to progressively realise this goal - is reviewed through various international human rights mechanisms, such as the Universal Periodic Review, or the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In many cases, the right to health has been adopted into domestic law or Constitutional law.,A rights-based approach to health requires that health policy and programmes must prioritize the needs of those furthest behind first towards greater equity, a principle that has been echoed in the recently adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Universal Health Coverage. (1),The right to health must be enjoyed without discrimination on the grounds of race, age, ethnicity or any other status. Non-discrimination and equality requires states to take steps to redress any discriminatory law, practice or policy.,Another feature of rights-based approaches is meaningful participation. Participation means ensuring that national stakeholders – including non-state actors such as non-governmental organizations – are meaningfully involved in all phases of programming: assessment, analysis, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.","More than 1 billion children vaccinated over the last decade,Most children today receive lifesaving vaccines,Uptake of new and underused vaccines is increasing.,Immunization currently prevents 2-3 million deaths every year,An estimated 19.7 million children under the age of one year did not receive basic vaccines","Every infant and child has the right to good nutrition according to the ""Convention on the Rights of the Child"".,Undernutrition is associated with 45% of child deaths.,Globally in 2019, 144 million children under 5 were estimated to be stunted (too short for age), 47 million were estimated to be wasted (too thin for height), and 38.3 million were overweight or obese.,About 40% of infants 0–6 months old are exclusively breastfed.,Few children receive nutritionally adequate and safe complementary foods; in many countries less than a fourth of infants 6–23 months of age meet the criteria of dietary diversity and feeding frequency that are appropriate for their age.,Over 820 000 children's lives could be saved every year among children under 5 years, if all children 0–23 months were optimally breastfed. Breastfeeding improves IQ, school attendance, and is associated with higher income in adult life. (1),Improving child development and reducing health costs through breastfeeding results in economic gains for individual families as well as at the national level.","Humans can be infected with avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza viruses, such as avian influenza virus subtypes A(H5N1), A(H7N9), and A(H9N2) and swine influenza virus subtypes A(H1N1), A(H1N2) and A(H3N2).,Human infections are primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments, these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans.,Avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza virus infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection (fever and cough), early sputum production and rapid progression to severe pneumonia, sepsis with shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported to varying degrees depending on subtype.,The majority of human cases of influenza A (H5N1) and A(H7N9) virus infection have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry. Controlling the disease in the animal source is critical to decrease risk to humans.,Influenza viruses, with the vast silent reservoir in aquatic birds, are impossible to eradicate. Zoonotic influenza infection in humans will continue to occur. To minimize public health risk, quality surveillance in both animal and human populations, thorough investigation of every human infection and risk-based pandemic planning are essential.","Ionizing radiation is a type of energy released by atoms in the form of electromagnetic waves or particles.,People are exposed to natural sources of ionizing radiation, such as in soil, water, and vegetation, as well as in human-made sources, such as x-rays and medical devices.,Ionizing radiation has many beneficial applications, including uses in medicine, industry, agriculture and research.,As the use of ionizing radiation increases, so does the potential for health hazards if not properly used or contained.,Acute health effects such as skin burns or acute radiation syndrome can occur when doses of radiation exceed certain levels.,Low doses of ionizing radiation can increase the risk of longer term effects such as cancer.","Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses, and is spread by mosquitoes.,JEV is the main cause of viral encephalitis in many countries of Asia with an estimated 68 000 clinical cases every year.,Although symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE) is rare, the case-fatality rate among those with encephalitis can be as high as 30%. Permanent neurologic or psychiatric sequelae can occur in 30%–50% of those with encephalitis.,24 countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions have endemic JEV transmission, exposing more than 3 billion people to risks of infection.,There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving severe clinical signs and supporting the patient to overcome the infection.,Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent JE. WHO recommends that JE vaccination be integrated into national immunization schedules in all areas where JE disease is recognized as a public health issue.","Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness of 2-21 days duration that occurs in West Africa.,The Lassa virus is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces.,Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in hospitals lacking adequate infection prevention and control measures.,Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well.,The overall case-fatality rate is 1%. Observed case-fatality rate among patients hospitalized with severe cases of Lassa fever is 15%.,Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.","Lead is a cumulative toxicant that affects multiple body systems and is particularly harmful to young children.,Lead in the body is distributed to the brain, liver, kidney and bones. It is stored in the teeth and bones, where it accumulates over time. Human exposure is usually assessed through the measurement of lead in blood.,Lead in bone is released into blood during pregnancy and becomes a source of exposure to the developing fetus.,There is no level of exposure to lead that is known to be without harmful effects.,Lead exposure is preventable.","The bacterium L. pneumophila was first identified in 1977, as the cause of an outbreak of severe pneumonia in a convention centre in the USA in 1976.,The most common form of transmission of Legionella is inhalation of contaminated aerosols produced in conjunction with water sprays, jets or mists. Infection can also occur by aspiration of contaminated water or ice, particularly in susceptible hospital patients.,Legionnaires’ disease has an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (but up to 16 days has been recorded in some outbreaks).,Death occurs through progressive pneumonia with respiratory failure and/or shock and multi-organ failure.,Untreated Legionnaires’ disease usually worsens during the first week.,Of the reported cases 75–80% are over 50 years and 60–70% are male.","There are 3 main forms of leishmaniases – visceral (also known as kala-azar, which is and the most serious form of the disease), cutaneous (the most common), and mucocutaneous.,Leishmaniasis is caused by the protozoan Leishmania parasites which are transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies.,The disease affects some of the poorest people on earth, and is associated with malnutrition, population displacement, poor housing, a weak immune system and lack of financial resources.,Leishmaniasis is linked to environmental changes such as deforestation, building of dams, irrigation schemes, and urbanization.,An estimated 700 000 to 1 million new cases aoccur annually.,Only a small fraction of those infected by Leishmania parasites will eventually develop the disease.","Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by a bacillus, Mycobacterium leprae.,M. leprae multiplies slowly and the incubation period of the disease, on average, is 5 years.,Symptoms may occur within 1 year but can also take as long as 20 years or even more to occur.,The disease mainly affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and the eyes.,Leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy (MDT).,Leprosy is likely transmitted via droplets, from the nose and mouth, during close and frequent contact with untreated cases.,Untreated, leprosy can cause progressive and permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes.,There were 208 619 new leprosy cases registered globally in 2018, according to official figures from 159 countries from the 6 WHO Regions.,Based on 184 212 cases at the end of 2018, prevalence rate corresponds to 0.2/10 000.","Listeriosis is a serious, but preventable and treatable disease.,Pregnant women, the elderly or individuals with a weakened immune system, such as people with immuno-compromised status due to HIV/AIDS, leukaemia, cancer, kidney transplant and steroid therapy, are at greatest risk of severe listeriosis and should avoid high risk foods.,High risk foods include deli meat and ready-to-eat meat products (such as cooked, cured and/or fermented meats and sausages), soft cheeses and cold smoked fishery products.,Listeria monocytogenes are widely distributed in nature. They can be found in soil, water, vegetation and the faeces of some animals and can contaminate foods.,Listeriosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes.","Lymphatic filariasis impairs the lymphatic system and can lead to the abnormal enlargement of body parts, causing pain, severe disability and social stigma.,893 million people in 49 countries worldwide remain threatened by lymphatic filariasis and require preventive chemotherapy to stop the spread of this parasitic infection.,In 2000 over 120 million people were infected, with about 40 million disfigured and incapacitated by the disease.,Lymphatic filariasis can be eliminated by stopping the spread of infection through preventive chemotherapy with safe medicine combinations repeated annually. More than 7.7 billion treatments have been delivered to stop the spread of infection since 2000.,597 million people no longer require preventive chemotherapy due to successful implementation of WHO strategies.,A basic, recommended package of care can alleviate suffering and prevent further disability among people living with disease caused by lymphatic filariasis.","Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable.,In 2018, there were an estimated 228 million cases of malaria worldwide.,The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 405 000 in 2018.,Children aged under 5 years are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria; in 2018, they accounted for 67% (272 000) of all malaria deaths worldwide.,The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2018, the region was home to 93% of malaria cases and 94% of malaria deaths.,Total funding for malaria control and elimination reached an estimated US$ 2.7 billion in 2018. Contributions from governments of endemic countries amounted to US$ 900 million, representing 30% of total funding.","Malnutrition, in all its forms, includes undernutrition (wasting, stunting, underweight), inadequate vitamins or minerals, overweight, obesity, and resulting diet-related noncommunicable diseases.,1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese, while 462 million are underweight.,47 million children under 5 years of age are wasted, 14.3 million are severely wasted and 144 million are stunted, while 38.3 million are overweight or obese.,Around 45% of deaths among children under 5 years of age are linked to undernutrition. These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries. At the same time, in these same countries, rates of childhood overweight and obesity are rising.,The developmental, economic, social, and medical impacts of the global burden of malnutrition are serious and lasting, for individuals and their families, for communities and for countries.","Marburg virus disease (MVD), formerly known as Marburg haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans.,Rousettus aegyptiacus, fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family, are considered to be natural hosts of Marburg virus. The Marburg virus is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads among humans through human-to-human transmission.,The Marburg virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever in humans.,The average MVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 24% to 88% in past outbreaks depending on virus strain and case management.,Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks.,Early supportive care with rehydration, symptomatic treatment improves survival. There is as yet no licensed treatment proven to neutralize the virus but a range of blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently under development.","Every day in 2017, approximately 810 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.,Between 2000 and 2017, the maternal mortality ratio (MMR, number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) dropped by about 38% worldwide.,94% of all maternal deaths occur in low and lower middle-income countries.,Young adolescents (ages 10-14) face a higher risk of complications and death as a result of pregnancy than other women.,Skilled care before, during and after childbirth can save the lives of women and newborns.","Even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available, in  2018, there were more than  140 000 measles deaths globally, mostly among children under the age of five.,Measles vaccination resulted in a  73% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and  2018 worldwide,In 2018, about  86% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday through routine health services – up from 72% in 2000.,During 2000- 2018, measles vaccination prevented an estimated  23.2 million deaths making measles vaccine one of the best buys in public health.","Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial form of meningitis, a serious infection of the thin lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.,Meningococcal meningitis is associated with high fatality (up to 50% when untreated) and high frequency (more than 10%) of severe sequelae. Early antibiotic treatment is the most important measure to save lives and reduce complications.,Meningococcal meningitis is observed worldwide but the highest burden of the disease is in the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa, stretching from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Around 30 000 cases are still reported each year from that area.,Serogroup specific vaccines are used for prevention (routine immunization) and in response to outbreaks (prompt reactive vaccination).,Since 2010 and the roll-out of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine through mass preventive immunization campaigns in the meningitis belt, the proportion of the A serogroup has declined dramatically.","There are many different mental disorders, with different presentations. They are generally characterized by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behaviour and relationships with others.,Mental disorders include: depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses, dementia, and developmental disorders including autism.,There are effective strategies for preventing mental disorders such as depression.,There are effective treatments for mental disorders and ways to alleviate the suffering caused by them.,Access to health care and social services capable of providing treatment and social support is key.","Almost all people affected by emergencies will experience psychological distress, which for most people will improve over time.,Among people who have experienced war or other conflict in the previous 10 years, one in 11 (9%) will have a moderate or severe mental disorder.,One person in five (22%) living in an area affected by conflict is estimated to have depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.,Depression tends to be more common among women than men.,Depression and anxiety become more common as people get older.,People with severe mental disorders are especially vulnerable during emergencies and need access to mental health care and other basic needs.,International guidelines recommend services at a number of levels   ̶  from basic services to clinical care   ̶ and indicate that mental health care needs to be made available immediately for specific, urgent mental health problems as part of the health response.,Despite their tragic nature and adverse effects on mental health, emergencies have shown to be opportunities to build sustainable mental health systems for all people in need.","Globally, the population is ageing rapidly. Between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the world’s population over 60 years will nearly double, from 12% to 22%.,Mental health and well-being are as important in older age as at any other time of life.,Mental and neurological disorders among older adults account for 6.6% of the total disability (DALYs) for this age group.,Approximately 15% of adults aged 60 and over suffer from a mental disorder.","Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders.,Mental health is an integral part of health; indeed, there is no health without mental health.,Mental health is determined by a range of socioeconomic, biological and environmental factors.,Cost-effective public health and intersectoral strategies and interventions exist to promote, protect and restore mental health.","Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is found in air, water and soil.,Exposure to mercury – even small amounts – may cause serious health problems, and is a threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life.,Mercury may have toxic effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes.,Mercury is considered by WHO as one of the top ten chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health concern.,People are mainly exposed to methylmercury, an organic compound, when they eat fish and shellfish that contain the compound.,Methylmercury is very different to ethylmercury. Ethylmercury is used as a preservative in some vaccines and does not pose a health risk.","Microcephaly is a condition where a baby is born with a small head or the head stops growing after birth.,Microcephaly is a rare condition. One baby in several thousand is born with microcephaly.,The most reliable way to assess whether a baby has microcephaly is to measure head circumference 24 hours after birth, compare the value with WHO growth standards, and continue to measure the rate of head growth in early infancy.,Babies born with microcephaly may develop convulsions and suffer physical and learning disabilities as they grow older.,There are no specific tests to determine if a baby will be born with microcephaly, but ultrasound scans in the third trimester of pregnancy can sometimes identify the problem.,There is no specific treatment for microcephaly.","Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012.,Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).,Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Some laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection are reported as asymptomatic, meaning that they do not have any clinical symptoms, yet they are positive for MERS-CoV infection following a laboratory test. Most of these asymptomatic cases have been detected following aggressive contact tracing of a laboratory-confirmed case.,Approximately 35% of reported patients with MERS-CoV infection have died.,Although most of human cases of MERS-CoV infections have been attributed to human-to-human infections in health care settings, current scientific evidence suggests that dromedary camels are a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and an animal source of MERS infection in humans. However, the exact role of dromedaries in transmission of the virus and the exact route(s) of transmission are unknown.,The virus does not seem to pass easily from person to person unless there is close contact, such as occurs when providing unprotected care to a patient. Health care associated outbreaks have occurred in several countries, with the largest outbreaks seen in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of Korea.","Globally, the number of deaths of children under 5 years of age fell from 12.7 million in 1990 to 6.3 million in 2013.,In developing countries, the percentage of underweight children under 5 years old dropped from 28% in 1990 to 17% in 2013.,Globally, new HIV infections declined by 38% between 2001 and 2013.,Existing cases of tuberculosis are declining, along with deaths among HIV-negative tuberculosis cases.,In 2010, the world met the United Nations Millennium Development Goals target on access to safe drinking-water, as measured by the proxy indicator of access to improved drinking-water sources, but more needs to be done to achieve the sanitation target.","Monkeypox is caused by monkeypox virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae.,Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease that occurs primarily in tropical rainforest areas of Central and West Africa and is occasionally exported to other regions.,Monkeypox typically presents clinically with fever, rash and swollen lymph nodes.,Monkeypox virus is mostly transmitted to people from wild animals such as rodents and primates, but human-to-human transmission also occurs.,Monkeypox virus is transmitted from one person to another by contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets and contaminated materials such as bedding.,Typically, up to a tenth of persons ill with monkeypox may die, with most deaths occurring in younger age groups.,The clinical presentation of monkeypox resembles that of smallpox, a related orthopoxvirus infection which was declared eradicated worldwide in 1980.,Vaccinia vaccine used during the smallpox eradication programme was also protective against monkeypox. A new third generation vaccinia vaccine has now been approved for prevention of smallpox and monkeypox. Antiviral agents are also being developed.","An estimated 0.9 million children aged 5 to 14 years died in 2018, about 2,500 deaths in this age group a day. Mortality rates for older children aged 5 to 9 years are higher than for young adolescents aged 10 to 14 years.,From 1990 to 2018, the mortality rate in children aged 5 to 14 years declined by 53 per cent, and the number of deaths dropped by 46 per cent from 1.7 (to 0.9 million per year.,On current trends, 9.8 million children aged 5–14 years will die between 2019 and 2030. Almost 80% of these projected deaths will occur in sub-Saharan Africa (5.8 million) and Southern Asia (2 million),Injuries (including road traffic injuries, drowning, burns, and falls) are leading causes of death and lifelong disability among older children and young adolescents. Infectious diseases have declined since 2000 for this age group.","Musculoskeletal conditions are the leading contributor to disability worldwide, with low back pain being the single leading cause of disability globally.,Musculoskeletal conditions and injuries are not just conditions of older age; they are prevalent across the life-course. Between one in three and one in five people(including children) live with a musculoskeletal pain condition.,Musculoskeletal conditions significantly limit mobility and dexterity, leading to early retirement from work, reduced accumulated wealth and reduced ability to participate in social roles.,The greatest proportion of non-cancer persistent pain conditions is accounted for by musculoskeletal conditions.,Highly prevalent among multi-morbidity health states, musculoskeletal conditions are prevalent in one third to one-half of multi-morbidity presentations, particularly in older people.,Musculoskeletal conditions are commonly linked with depression and increase the risk of developing other chronic health conditions.","Mycetoma is a chronic, progressively destructive infectious disease of the subcutaneous tissues, affecting skin, muscle and bone.,Mycetoma can be caused by different species of microorganisms, but almost always by bacteria or fungus.,Mycetoma occurs in tropical and subtropical environments characterized by short rainy seasons and prolonged dry seasons that favour the growth of thorny bushes.,Global burden is not known, but the disease is endemic; it has been reported from countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America.,Mycetoma has numerous adverse medical, health and socioeconomic consequences for patients, communities and health services in affected areas.,People living in or travelling to endemic areas should be advised not to walk barefoot, as footwear and clothing in general can protect against puncture wounds.","Mycotoxins are naturally occurring toxins produced by certain moulds (fungi) and can be found in food.,The moulds grow on a variety of different crops and foodstuffs including cereals, nuts, spices, dried fruits, apples and coffee beans, often under warm and humid conditions. ,Mycotoxins can cause a variety of adverse health effects and pose a serious health threat to both humans and livestock.,The adverse health effects of mycotoxins range from acute poisoning to long-term effects such as immune deficiency and cancer. ,A scientific expert committee jointly convened by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) – called JECFA – is the international body responsible for evaluating the health risk from natural toxins including mycotoxins.,International standards and codes of practice to limit exposure to mycotoxins from certain foods are established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission based on JECFA assessments.","Some natural toxins can be formed in food as defense mechanisms of plants, through their infestation with toxin-producing mould, or through ingestion by animals of toxin-producing microorganisms.,Natural toxins can cause a variety of adverse health effects and pose a serious health threat to both humans and livestock. Some of these toxins are extremely potent.,Adverse health effects can be acute poisoning ranging from allergic reactions to severe stomachache and diarrhoea, and even death.,Long-term health consequences include effects on the immune, reproductive or nervous systems, and also cancer.,A scientific expert committee jointly convened by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) – called JECFA – is the international body responsible for evaluating the health risk from natural toxins in food.,International standards and codes of practice to limit exposure to natural toxins from certain foods are established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission based on JECFA assessments.","Globally 2.5 million children died in the first month of life in 2018 —approximately 7 000 newborn deaths every day with about one third dying on the day of birth and close to three quarters dying within the first week of life.,Neonatal mortality declined more slowly than mortality among children aged 1–59 months. As a result, the share of neonatal deaths among all under-five deaths increased from 40 (39, 41) per cent in 1990 to 47 (45, 49) per cent in,Children who die within the first 28 days of birth suffer from conditions and diseases associated with lack of quality care at birth or skilled care and treatment immediately after birth and in the first days of life.,Preterm birth, intrapartum-related complications (birth asphyxia or lack of breathing at birth), infections and birth defects cause most neonatal deaths.,Women who receive midwife-led continuity of care (MLCC) provided by professional midwives, educated and regulated to internationals standards, are 16% less likely to lose their baby and 24% less likely to experience pre-term birth.","Nipah virus infection in humans causes a range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic infection (subclinical) to acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis.,The case fatality rate is estimated at 40% to 75%. This rate can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management.,Nipah virus can be transmitted to humans from animals (such as bats or pigs), or contaminated foods and can also be transmitted directly from human-to-human.,Fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are the natural host of Nipah virus.,There is no treatment or vaccine available for either people or animals. The primary treatment for humans is supportive care.,The 2018 annual review of the WHO R&D Blueprint list of priority diseases indicates that there is an urgent need for accelerated research and development for the Nipah virus.","Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) kill 41 million people each year, equivalent to 71% of all deaths globally.,Each year, 15 million people die from a NCD between the ages of 30 and 69 years; over 85% of these ""premature"" deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.,Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, or 17.9 million people annually, followed by cancers (9.0 million), respiratory diseases (3.9million), and diabetes (1.6 million).,These 4 groups of diseases account for over 80% of all premature NCD deaths.,Tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets all increase the risk of dying from a NCD.,Detection, screening and treatment of NCDs, as well as palliative care, are key components of the response to NCDs.","As part of strong multi-disciplinary health care teams, nurses and midwives make a significant contribution to delivering on the commitments made in the 2018 Astana Declaration on Primary Health Care, ensuring patient-centred care close to the community.,Nurses and midwives account for nearly 50% of the global health workforce.,There is a global shortage of health workers, in particular nurses and midwives, who represent more than 50% of the current shortage in health workers.,The largest needs-based shortages of nurses and midwives are in South East Asia and Africa.,For all countries to reach Sustainable Development Goal 3 on health and well-being, WHO estimates that the world will need an additional 9 million nurses and midwives by the year 2030.,Nurses play a critical role in health promotion, disease prevention and delivering primary and community care. They provide care in emergency settings and will be key to the achievement of universal health coverage.,Achieving health for all will depend on there being sufficient numbers of well-trained and educated, regulated and well supported nurses and midwives, who receive pay and recognition commensurate with the services and quality of care that they provide.,Investing in nurses and midwives is good value for money. The report of the UN High Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth concluded that investments in education and job creation in the health and social sectors result in a triple return of improved health outcomes, global health security, and inclusive economic growth.,Globally, 70% of the health and social workforce are women compared to 41% in all employment sectors. Nursing and midwifery occupations represent a significant share of the female workforce.","Worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975.,In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these over 650 million were obese.,39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016, and 13% were obese.,Most of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight.,38 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2019.,Over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 were overweight or obese in 2016.,Obesity is preventable.","Onchocerciasis, commonly known as “river blindness”, is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus.,It is transmitted to humans through exposure to repeated bites of infected blackflies of the genus Simulium,Symptoms include severe itching, disfiguring skin conditions, and visual impairment, including permanent blindness. ,More than 99% of infected people live in 31 African countries. The disease also exists in some foci in Latin America and Yemen.,The Global Burden of Disease Study estimated in 2017 that there were 20.9 million prevalent O. volvulus infections worldwide: 14.6 million of the infected people had skin disease and 1.15 million had vision loss,Community-directed treatment with ivermectin is the core strategy to eliminate onchocerciasis in Africa. In the Americas the strategy is biannual large-scale treatment with ivermectin.,Four countries have been verified by WHO as free of onchocerciasis after successfully implementing elimination activities for decades: Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Guatemala,By the end of 2017, three additional countries had stopped mass drug administration and completed 3 years of post-treatment surveillance in at least one transmission area: Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Uganda, and Sudan,1.8 million people live in areas that no longer require mass drug administration for onchocerciasis.","Oral diseases pose a major health burden for many countries and affect people throughout their lifetime, causing pain, discomfort, disfigurement and even death.,These diseases share common risk factors with other major noncommunicable diseases. (1),It is estimated that oral diseases affect nearly 3.5 billion people. (2),Untreated dental caries (tooth decay) in permanent teeth is the most common health condition according to the Global Burden of Disease 2017. (1),More than 530 million children suffer from dental caries of primary teeth (milk teeth).,Severe periodontal (gum) disease, which may result in tooth loss, is also very common, with almost 10% of the global population affected.,Oral cancer (cancer of the lip or mouth) is one of the three most common cancers in some countries of Asia and the Pacific. (3),Treatment for oral health conditions is expensive and usually not part of universal health coverage (UHC). In most high-income countries, dental treatment averages 5% of total health expenditure and 20% of out-of-pocket health expenditure.,Most low- and middle-income countries are unable to provide services to prevent and treat oral health conditions.,Factors contributing to oral diseases are an unhealthy diet high in sugar, use of tobacco and harmful use of alcohol.,Most oral health conditions are largely preventable and can be treated in their early stages.","Palliative care improves the quality of life of patients and their families who are facing problems associated with life-threatening illness, whether physical, psychosocial or spiritual.,Each year, an estimated 40 million people are in need of palliative care, 78% of them people live in low- and middle-income countries.,Worldwide, only about 14% of people who need palliative care currently receive it.,Overly restrictive regulations for morphine and other essential controlled palliative medicines deny access to adequate pain relief and palliative care.,Lack of training and awareness of palliative care among health professionals is a major barrier to improving access.,The global need for palliative care will continue to grow as a result of the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases and ageing populations.,Early palliative care reduces unnecessary hospital admissions and the use of health services.","The occurrence of adverse events due to unsafe care is likely one of the 10 leading causes of death and disability in the world (1).,In high-income countries, it is estimated that one in every 10 patients is harmed while receiving hospital care (2). The harm can be caused by a range of adverse events, with nearly 50% of them being preventable (3).,Each year, 134 million adverse events occur in hospitals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), due to unsafe care, resulting in 2.6 million deaths (4).,Another study has estimated that around two-thirds of all adverse events resulting from unsafe care, and the years lost to disability and death (known as disability adjusted life years, or DALYs) occur in LMICs (5).,Globally, as many as 4 in 10 patients are harmed in primary and outpatient health care. Up to 80% of harm is preventable. The most detrimental errors are related to diagnosis, prescription and the use of medicines (6).,In OECD countries, 15% of total hospital activity and expenditure is a direct result of adverse events (2).,Investments in reducing patient harm can lead to significant financial savings, and more importantly better patient outcomes (2). An example of prevention is engaging patients, if done well, it can reduce the burden of harm by up to 15% (6).","Pesticides are used to protect crops against insects, weeds, fungi and other pests.,Pesticides are potentially toxic to humans and can have both acute and chronic health effects, depending on the quantity and ways in which a person is exposed.,Some of the older, cheaper pesticides can remain for years in soil and water. These chemicals have been banned from agricultural use in developed countries, but they are still used in many developing countries.,People who face the greatest health risks from exposure to pesticides are those who come into contact with them at work, in their home or garden.,Pesticides play a significant role in food production. They protect or increase yields and the number of times per year a crop can be grown on the same land. This is particularly important in countries that face food shortages.,To protect food consumers from adverse effects of pesticides, WHO reviews evidence and develops internationally-accepted maximum residue limits.","Insufficient physical activity is one of the leading risk factors for death worldwide.,Insufficient physical activity is a key risk factor for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes.,Physical activity has significant health benefits and contributes to prevent NCDs.,Globally, 1 in 4 adults is not active enough.,More than 80% of the world's adolescent population is insufficiently physically active.,Policies to address insufficient physical activity are operational in 56% of WHO Member States.,WHO Member States have agreed to reduce insufficient physical activity by 10% by 2025.","Plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria usually found in small mammals and their fleas.,People infected with Y. pestis often develop symptoms after an incubation period of one to seven days.,There are two main clinical forms of plague infection: bubonic and pneumonic. Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes or 'buboes'.,Plague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.,Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated.,Antibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria, so early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives.,From 2010 to 2015 there were 3248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths.,Currently, the three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru.","Pneumonia accounts for 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old, killing 808 694 children in 2017.,Pneumonia can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi.,Pneumonia can be prevented by immunization, adequate nutrition, and by addressing environmental factors.,Pneumonia caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but only one third of children with pneumonia receive the antibiotics they need.","Polio (poliomyelitis) mainly affects children under 5 years of age.,1 in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5% to 10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized.,Cases due to wild poliovirus have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated 350 000 cases then, to 33 reported cases in 2018.,As long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk of contracting polio. Failure to eradicate polio from these last remaining strongholds could result in as many as 200 000 new cases every year, within 10 years, all over the world.,In most countries, the global effort has expanded capacities to tackle other infectious diseases by building effective surveillance and immunization systems.","Every year, billions of US dollars worth of medicines are purchased by or through international procurement agencies – such as UNICEF, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and UNITAID – for distribution in resource-limited countries.,The WHO Prequalification of Medicines Programme (PQP) helps ensure that medicines supplied by procurement agencies meet acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy.,At the end of 2012, the WHO List of Prequalified Medicinal Products contained 316 medicines for priority diseases.,WHO's list of prequalified medicinal products is used by international procurement agencies and increasingly by countries to guide bulk purchasing of medicines.,PQP also prequalifies active pharmaceutical ingredients and quality control laboratories.","Every year, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm (before 37 completed weeks of gestation), and this number is rising.,Preterm birth complications are the leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age, responsible for approximately 1 million deaths in 2015 (1).,Three-quarters of these deaths could be prevented with current, cost-effective interventions.,Across 184 countries, the rate of preterm birth ranges from 5% to 18% of babies born.","Between 2010–2014, on average, 56 million induced (safe and unsafe) abortions occurred worldwide each year.,There were 35 induced abortions per 1000 women aged between 15–44 years.,25% of all pregnancies ended in an induced abortion.,The rate of abortions was higher in developing regions than in developed regions.,Around 25 million unsafe abortions were estimated to have taken place worldwide each year, almost all in developing countries (1).,Among these, 8 million were carried out in the least- safe or dangerous conditions.,Over half of all estimated unsafe abortions globally were in Asia.,3 out of 4 abortions that occurred in Africa and Latin America were unsafe.,The risk of dying from an unsafe abortion was the highest in Africa.,Each year between 4.7% – 13.2% of maternal deaths can be attributed to unsafe abortion (2).,Around 7 million women are admitted to hospitals every year in developing countries, as a result of unsafe abortion (3).,The annual cost of treating major complications from unsafe abortion is estimated at US$ 553 million (4).,Safe abortion must be provided or supported by a trained person using WHO recommended methods appropriate for the pregnancy duration.,Almost every abortion death and disability could be prevented through sexuality education, use of effective contraception, provision of safe, legal induced abortion, and timely care for complications (5).","Primary health care can cover the majority of a person’s health needs throughout their life including prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care.,At least half of the world’s people still lack full coverage of essential health services.,A fit-for-purpose workforce is essential to deliver primary health care, yet the world has an estimated shortfall of 18 million health workers.,Of the 30 countries for which data are available, only 8 spend at least US$ 40 per person on primary health care per year.","In many countries more than half of workers are employed in the informal sector with no social protection for seeking health care and lack of regulatory enforcement of occupational health and safety standards.,Occupational health services to advise employers on improving working conditions and monitoring the health of workers cover mostly big companies in the formal sector and more than 85% of workers in small enterprises, informal sector, agriculture and migrants worldwide do not have any occupational health coverage.,Certain occupational risks, such as injuries, noise, carcinogenic agents, airborne particles and ergonomic risks account for a substantial part of the burden of chronic diseases: 37% of all cases of back pain, 16% of hearing loss, 13% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 11% of asthma, 8% of injuries, 9% of lung cancer, 2% of leukaemia and 8% of depression.,Annually 12.2 million people, mostly in developing countries, die from noncommunicable diseases while still of active working age.,Work-related health problems result in an economic loss of 4–6% of GDP for most countries. The basic health services to prevent occupational and work-related diseases cost on average between US$ 18 and US$ 60 (purchasing power parity) per worker.,About 70% of workers do not have any insurance to compensate them in case of occupational diseases and injuries.,Research has demonstrated that workplace health initiatives can help reduce sick leave absenteeism by 27% and health-care costs for companies by 26%.","Rabies is a vaccine-preventable viral disease which occurs in more than 150 countries and territories.,Dogs are the main source of human rabies deaths, contributing up to 99% of all rabies transmissions to humans.,Interrupting  transmission is feasible through vaccination of dogs and prevention of dog bites.,Infection causes tens of thousands of deaths every year, mainly in Asia and Africa.,Globally rabies causes an estimated cost of US$ 8.6 billion per year,40% of people bitten by suspect rabid animals are children under 15 years of age.,Immediate, thorough wound washing with soap and water after contact with a suspect rabid animal is crucial and can save lives.,Engagement of multiple sectors and One Health collaboration including community education, awareness programmes and vaccination campaigns are critical.,WHO leads the collective  “United Against Rabies” to drive progress towards ""Zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030"".","Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which may be found in indoor environments such as homes, schools, and workplaces.,Radon is the most important cause of lung cancer after smoking.,Radon is estimated to cause between 3–14% of all lung cancers in a country, depending on the national average radon level and smoking prevalence.,The lower the radon concentration in a home, the lower the risk of lung cancer as there is no known threshold below which radon exposure carries no risk.,Well-tested, durable and cost-efficient methods exist for preventing radon in new houses and reducing radon in existing dwellings.","Rehabilitation is a set of interventions needed when a person is experiencing or is likely to experience limitations in everyday functioning due to ageing or a health condition, including chronic diseases or disorders, injuries or traumas. Examples of limitations in functioning are difficulties in thinking, seeing, hearing, communicating, moving around, having relationships or keeping a job.,Rehabilitation is an essential component of universal health coverage along with promotion, prevention, treatment and palliation.,There is an increasing need for rehabilitation worldwide associated with changing health and demographic trends of increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases and population ageing. The proportion of individuals aged over 60 is predicted to double by 2050 and there has been an 18% increase in the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases in the last 10 years.,15% of all years lived with disability (YLDs) are caused by health conditions associated with severe levels of disability. Rehabilitation is a fundamental health intervention for people living with these conditions.,At present the subsequent need for rehabilitation is largely unmet. For example, in many low- and middle-income countries, there is a lack of trained professionals to provide rehabilitation services, with less than 10 skilled practitioners per 1 million population.","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans.,The majority of human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals.,Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes.,To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF virus has been documented.,The incubation period (the interval from infection to onset of symptoms) for RVF varies from 2 to 6 days.,Outbreaks of RVF in animals can be prevented by a sustained programme of animal vaccination.","Approximately 1.35 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes.,The2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has set an ambitious target of halving the global number of deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by 2020.,Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.,More than half of all road traffic deaths are among vulnerable road users: pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists.,93% of the world's fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries have approximately 60% of the world's vehicles.,Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 years.","Rubella is a contagious viral infection that occurs most often in children and young adults.,Rubella is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Rubella infection in pregnant women may cause fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome.,There is no specific treatment for rubella but the disease is preventable by vaccination.","Salmonella is 1 of 4 key global causes of diarrhoeal diseases.,Most cases of salmonellosis are mild; however, sometimes it can be life-threatening. The severity of the disease depends on host factors and the serotype of Salmonella.,Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health concern and Salmonella is one of the microorganisms in which some resistant serotypes have emerged, affecting the food chain.,Basic food hygiene practices, such as ""cook thoroughly"", are recommended as a preventive measure against salmonellosis.","High sodium consumption (>2 grams/day, equivalent to 5 g salt/day) and insufficient potassium intake (less than 3.5 grams/day) contribute to high blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.,The main source of sodium in our diet is salt, although it can come from sodium glutamate, used as a condiment in many parts of the world.,Most people consume too much salt—on average 9–12 grams per day, or around twice the recommended maximum level of intake.,Salt intake of less than 5 grams per day for adults helps to reduce blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and coronary heart attack. The principal benefit of lowering salt intake is a corresponding reduction in high blood pressure.,WHO Member States have agreed to reduce the global population’s intake of salt by a relative 30% by 2025.,Reducing salt intake has been identified as one of the most cost-effective measures countries can take to improve population health outcomes. Key salt reduction measures will generate an extra year of healthy life for a cost that falls below the average annual income or gross domestic product per person.,An estimated 2.5 million deaths could be prevented each year if global salt consumption were reduced to the recommended level.","In 2017, 45% of the global population (3.4 billion people) used a safely managed sanitation service.,31% of the global population (2.4 billion people) used private sanitation facilities connected to sewers from which wastewater was treated.,14% of the global population (1.0 billion people) used toilets or latrines where excreta were disposed of in situ.,74% of the world’s population (5.5 billion people) used at least a basic sanitation service.,2.0 billion people still do not have basic sanitation facilities such as toilets or latrines.,Of these, 673 million still defecate in the open, for example in street gutters, behind bushes or into open bodies of water.,At least 10% of the world’s population is thought to consume food irrigated by wastewater.,Cropland in peri-urban areas irrigated by mostly untreated urban wastewater is estimated to be approximately 36 million hectares (equivalent to the size of Germany),Poor sanitation is linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio and exacerbates stunting.,Poor sanitation reduces human well-being, social and economic development due to impacts such as anxiety, risk of sexual assault, and lost educational opportunities.,Inadequate sanitation is estimated to cause 432 000 diarrhoeal deaths annually and is a major factor in several neglected tropical diseases, including intestinal worms, schistosomiasis, and trachoma. Poor sanitation also contributes to malnutrition.","Schistosomiasis is an acute and chronic disease caused by parasitic worms.,People are infected during routine agricultural, domestic, occupational, and recreational activities, which expose them to infested water.,Lack of hygiene and certain play habits of school-aged children such as swimming or fishing in infested water make them especially vulnerable to infection.,Schistosomiasis control focuses on reducing disease through periodic, large-scale population treatment with praziquantel; a more comprehensive approach including potable water, adequate sanitation, and snail control would also reduce transmission.,Estimates show that at least 290.8 million people required preventive treatment for schistosomiasis in 2018, out of which more than 97.2 million people were reported to have been treated.","Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder affecting 20 million people worldwide (1).,Schizophrenia is characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self and behaviour. Common experiences include hallucinations (hearing voices or seeing things that are not there) and delusions (fixed, false beliefs).,Worldwide, schizophrenia is associated with considerable disability and may affect educational and occupational performance.,People with schizophrenia are 2-3 times more likely to die early than the general population (2). This is often due to preventable physical diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease and infections.,Stigma, discrimination and violation of human rights of people with schizophrenia is common.,Schizophrenia is treatable. Treatment with medicines and psychosocial support is effective.,Facilitation of assisted living, supported housing and supported employment are effective management strategies for people with schizophrenia.","Self-care health interventions include drugs, devices, diagnostics and digital products that are provided fully or partially outside of formal health services.,People and caregivers choose self-care health interventions for convenience or choice, or to avoid health systems due to stigma, lack of access, or lack of quality.,Before using a self-care health intervention it is important to have evidence that it does no harm at the individual or population level. Unsafe use of unregulated or substandard products can be harmful.,Self-care can allow health providers to serve a greater number of patients, improve progress towards universal health coverage, and reach people in humanitarian crises.","Sepsis arises when the body’s response to an infection injures its own tissues and organs, potentially leading to death or significant morbidity.,The global epidemiological burden of sepsis is difficult to ascertain. It is estimated to affect more than 30 million people worldwide every year, potentially leading to 6 million deaths (1). The burden of sepsis is most likely highest in low- and middle-income countries.,It is estimated that 3 million newborns and 1.2 million children suffer from sepsis globally every year (2). Three out of every ten deaths due to neonatal sepsis are thought to be caused by resistant pathogens (3).,One in ten deaths associated with pregnancy and childbirth is due to maternal sepsis with over 95% of deaths due to maternal sepsis occurring in low- and middle-income countries (4). One million newborn deaths are associated with maternal infection, such as maternal sepsis, each year (5).,Sepsis can be the clinical manifestation of infections acquired both in the community setting or in health care facilities. Health care-associated infections are one of, if not the most frequent type of adverse event to occur during care delivery and affect hundreds of millions of patients worldwide every year (6). Since these infections are often resistant to antibiotics, they can rapidly lead to deteriorating clinical conditions.","More than 1 million sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are acquired every day worldwide (1, 2).,Each year, there are an estimated 376 million new infections with 1 of 4 STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis (1, 2).,More than 500 million people are estimated to have genital infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) (3).,More than 290 million women have a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (4).,The majority of STIs have no symptoms or only mild symptoms that may not be recognized as an STI.,STIs such as HSV type 2 and syphilis can increase the risk of HIV acquisition.,988 000 pregnant women were infected with syphilis in 2016, resulting in over 350 000 adverse birth outcomes including 200 000 stillbirths and newborn deaths (5).,In some cases, STIs can have serious reproductive health consequences beyond the immediate impact of the infection itself (e.g., infertility or mother-to-child transmission),The Gonococcal Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Programme has shown high rates of quinolone resistance, increasing azithromycin resistance and emerging resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Drug resistance, especially for gonorrhoea, is a major threat to reducing the impact of STIs worldwide.","Though the exact number of snake bites is unknown, an estimated 5.4 million people are bitten each year with up to 2.7 million envenomings.,Around 81 000 to 138 000 people die each year because of snake bites, and around three times as many amputations and other permanent disabilities are caused by snakebites annually.,Bites by venomous snakes can cause paralysis that may prevent breathing, bleeding disorders that can lead to a fatal haemorrhage, irreversible kidney failure and tissue damage that can cause permanent disability and limb amputation.,Agricultural workers and children are the most affected. Children often suffer more severe effects than adults, due to their smaller body mass.","Soil-transmitted helminth infections are caused by different species of parasitic worms.,They are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces, which contaminate the soil in areas where sanitation is poor.,Approximately 1.5 billion people are infected with soil-transmitted helminths worldwide.,Infected children are nutritionally and physically impaired.,Control is based on periodical deworming to eliminate infecting worms, health education to prevent re-infection, and improved sanitation to reduce soil contamination with infective eggs.,Safe and effective medicines are available to control infection.","Every year, around the world, between 250 000 and 500 000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI).,The majority of spinal cord injuries are due to preventable causes such as road traffic crashes, falls or violence.,People with a spinal cord injury are two to five times more likely to die prematurely than people without a spinal cord injury, with worse survival rates in low- and middle-income countries.,Spinal cord injury is associated with lower rates of school enrollment and economic participation, and it carries substantial individual and societal costs.","Substandard and falsified medical products may cause harm to patients and fail to treat the diseases for which they were intended.,They lead to loss of confidence in medicines, healthcare providers and health systems.,They affect every region of the world.,Substandard and falsified medical products from all main therapeutic categories have been reported to WHO including medicines, vaccines and in vitro diagnostics.,Anti-malarials and antibiotics are amongst the most commonly reported substandard and falsified medical products.,Both generic and innovator medicines can be falsified, ranging from very expensive products for cancer to very inexpensive products for treatment of pain.,They can be found in illegal street markets, via unregulated websites through to pharmacies, clinics and hospitals.,An estimated 1 in 10 medical products in low- and middle-income countries is substandard or falsified.,Substandard and falsified medical products contribute to antimicrobial resistance and drug-resistant infections.","Dental caries  (also known as tooth decay or dental cavities) is the most common noncommunicable disease worldwide.,Severe dental caries  affects general health and often causes pain and infection, which may result in tooth extraction.,Dental caries is an expensive disease to treat, consuming 5–10% of healthcare budgets in industrialized countries, and is among the main reasons for hospitalization of children in some high-income countries.,Free sugars  are the essential dietary factor in the development of dental caries. Dental caries develops when bacteria in the mouth metabolize sugars to produce acid that demineralizes the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel and dentine).,In many countries, sugars-sweetened beverages, including fruit-based and milk-based sweetened drinks and 100% fruit juices, are a primary source of free sugars, as well as confectionery, cakes, biscuits, sweetened cereals, sweet desserts, sucrose, honey, syrups and preserves.,Limiting free sugars intake to less than 10% of total energy intake – and ideally even further, to less than 5% – minimizes the risk of dental caries throughout the lifecourse.,Severe dental caries is a frequent cause of absenteeism at school or work. An association between dental caries and undernutrition in children has been reported in some low- and middle-income countries; however, whether this is cause or effect, or both, remains to be determined.","Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year.,For every suicide there are many more people who attempt suicide every year. A prior suicide attempt is the single most important risk factor for suicide in the general population.,Suicide is the third leading cause of death in 15-19-year-olds.  ,79% of global suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries.,Ingestion of pesticide, hanging and firearms are among the most common methods of suicide globally.","The term taeniasis referes to intestinal infection with tapeworms.,Three parasite species cause taeniasis in humans, Taenia solium, Taenia saginata and Taenia asiatica. Only T. solium causes major health problems.,T. solium taeniasis is acquired by humans through the ingestion of the parasite's larval cysts (cysticerci) in undercooked and infected pork.,Human tapeworm carriers excrete tapeworm eggs in their faeces and contaminate the environment when they defecate in open areas.,Humans can also become infected with T. solium eggs due to poor hygiene (via the fecal-oral route) or ingesting contaminated food or water.,Ingested T. solium eggs develop to larvae (called cysticerci) in various organs of the human body. When they enter the central nervous system they can cause neurological symptoms (neurocysticercosis), including epileptic seizures.,T. solium is the cause of 30% of epilepsy cases in many endemic areas where people and roaming pigs live in close proximity. In high risk communities it can be associated with as many as 70% of epilepsy cases.,More than 80% of the world's 50 million people who are affected by epilepsy live in low and lower-middle income countries.","Tetanus is acquired through infection of a cut or wound with the spores of the bacterium Clostridium tetani, and most cases occur within 14 days of infection. Tetanus cannot be transmitted from person to person. ,Tetanus can be prevented through immunization with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines (TTCV). However, people who recover from tetanus do not have natural immunity and can be infected again.,The majority of reported tetanus cases are birth-associated among newborn babies and mothers who have not been sufficiently vaccinated with TTCV.,In 2015, about 34 000 newborns died from neonatal tetanus, a 96% reduction since 1988, largely due to scaled-up immunization with TTCV.,In 2016, 86% of infants worldwide were vaccinated with 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) containing vaccine.","Tobacco kills up to half of its users.,Tobacco kills more than 8 million people each year. More than 7 million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use while around 1.2 million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke.,Over 80% of the world's 1.3 billion tobacco users live in low- and middle-income countries.","Trachoma is a disease of the eye caused by infection with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis.,It is a public health problem in 44 countries, and is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people.,Blindness from trachoma is irreversible.,Based on March 2020 data, 137 million people live in trachoma endemic areas and are at risk of trachoma blindness.,Infection spreads through personal contact (via hands, clothes or bedding) and by flies that have been in contact with discharge from the eyes or nose of an infected person. With repeated episodes of infection over many years, the eyelashes may be drawn in so that they rub on the surface of the eye, with pain and discomfort and permanent damage to the cornea.,The elimination strategy is summarized by the acronym ""SAFE"", which means Surgery for advanced disease, Antibiotics to clear C. trachomatis infection, Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvement to reduce transmission.,The World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA51.11 in 1998, targeting the global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem.,In 2019, 92 622 people received surgical treatment for advanced stage of the disease, and 95.2 million people were treated with antibiotics. Global-level antibiotic coverage in 2019 was 57%.","Sleeping sickness is caused by parasites transmitted by infected tsetse flies and is endemic in 36 sub-Saharan African countries. Without treatment, the disease is considered fatal. where there are tsetse flies that transmit the disease.,The people most exposed to the tsetse fly and to the disease live in rural areas and depend on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting.,Human African trypanosomiasis takes 2 forms, depending on the parasite involved: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense accounts for more than 98% of reported cases.,Sustained control efforts have reduced the number of new cases. In 2009 the number reported dropped below 10 000 for the first time in 50 years, and in 2018 there were 977 cases recorded.,Diagnosis and treatment of the disease is complex and requires specifically skilled staff."," A total of 1.5 million people died from TB in 2018 (including 251 000 people with HIV). Worldwide, TB is one of the top 10 causes of death and the leading cause from a single infectious agent (above HIV/AIDS).,In 2018, an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis(TB) worldwide. 5.7 million men, 3.2 million women and 1.1 million children. There were cases in all countries and age groups. But TB is curable and preventable. ,In 2018, 1.1 million children fell ill with TB globally, and there were 205 000 child deaths due to TB (including among children with HIV). Child and adolescent  TB is often overlooked by health providers and can be difficult to diagnose and treat. ,In 2018, the 30 high TB burden countries accounted for 87% of new TB cases. Eight countries account for two thirds of the total, with India leading the count, followed by, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and South Africa. ,Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a public health crisis and a health security threat. WHO estimates that there were 484 000 new cases with resistance to rifampicin – the most effective first-line drug, of which 78% had MDR-TB.,Globally, TB incidence is falling at about 2% per year. This needs to accelerate to a 4–5% annual decline to reach the 2020 milestones of the End TB Strategy.,An estimated 58 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2018.,Ending the TB epidemic by 2030 is among the health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals.","Typhoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. It is usually spread through contaminated food or water.,An estimated 11–20 million people get sick from typhoid and between 128 000 and 161 000 people die from it every year.,Symptoms include prolonged fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhoea. Some patients may have a rash. Severe cases may lead to serious complications or even death.,Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics although increasing resistance to different types of antibiotics is making treatment more complicated.,Two vaccines have been used for many years to prevent typhoid. A new typhoid conjugate vaccine with longer lasting immunity was prequalified by WHO in December 2017.","At least half of the world’s population still do not have full coverage of essential health services.,About 100 million people are still being pushed into extreme poverty (defined as living on 1.90 USD  or less a day) because they have to pay for health care.,Over 930 million people (around 12% of the world’s population) spend at least 10% of their household budgets to pay for health care.,All UN Member States have agreed to try to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030, as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.","Vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases, causing more than 700 000 deaths annually. They can be caused by either parasites, bacteria or viruses.,Malaria is a parasitic infection transmitted by Anopheline mosquitoes. It causes an estimated 219 million cases globally, and results in more than 400,000 deaths every year. Most of the deaths occur in children under the age of 5 years.,Dengue is the most prevalent viral infection transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. More than 3.9 billion people in over 129 countries are at risk of contracting dengue, with an estimated 96 million symptomatic cases and an estimated 40,000 deaths every year.,Other viral diseases transmitted by vectors include chikungunya fever, Zika virus fever, yellow fever, West Nile fever, Japanese encephalitis (all transmitted by mosquitoes), tick-borne encephalitis (transmitted by ticks).,Other vector-borne diseases such as Chagas disease (transmitted by triatomine bugs), leishmaniasis (sandflies) and schistosomiasis (snails) affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide.,Many of vector-borne diseases are preventable, through protective measures, and community mobilisation.","Violence against children includes all forms of violence against people under 18 years old, whether perpetrated by parents or other caregivers, peers, romantic partners, or strangers.,Globally, it is estimated that up to 1 billion children aged 2–17 years, have experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence or neglect in the past year (1).,Experiencing violence in childhood impacts lifelong health and well-being.,Target 16.2 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is to “end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against, and torture of, children”.,Evidence from around the world shows that violence against children can be prevented.","Violence against women – particularly intimate partner violence and sexual violence – is a major public health problem and a violation of women's human rights.,Global estimates published by WHO indicate that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime.,Most of this violence is intimate partner violence. Worldwide, almost one third (30%) of women who have been in a relationship report that they have experienced some form of physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner in their lifetime.,Globally, as many as 38% of murders of women are committed by a male intimate partner.,Violence can negatively affect women’s physical, mental, sexual, and reproductive health, and may increase the risk of acquiring HIV in some settings.,Men are more likely to perpetrate violence if they have low education, a history of child maltreatment, exposure to domestic violence against their mothers, harmful use of alcohol, unequal gender norms including attitudes accepting of violence, and a sense of entitlement over women.,Women are more likely to experience intimate partner violence if they have low education, exposure to mothers being abused by a partner, abuse during childhood, and attitudes accepting violence, male privilege, and women’s subordinate status.,There is evidence that advocacy and empowerment counselling interventions, as well as home visitation are promising in preventing or reducing intimate partner violence against women.,Situations of conflict, post conflict and displacement may exacerbate existing violence, such as by intimate partners, as well as and non-partner sexual violence, and may also lead to new forms of violence against women.","West Nile virus can cause a fatal neurological disease in humans.,However, approximately 80% of people who are infected will not show any symptoms.,West Nile virus is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes.,The virus can cause severe disease and death in horses.,Vaccines are available for use in horses but not yet available for people.,Birds are the natural hosts of West Nile virus.","Yaws is a chronic disfiguring and debilitating childhood infectious disease.,Yaws affects skin, bone and cartilage. Humans are currently believed to be the only reservoir, and transmission is from person to person.,Yaws is cured with a single oral dose of an inexpensive antibiotic called azithromycin. ,Yaws was one of the first diseases targeted for eradication in the 1950s. WHO renewed global efforts to eradicate yaws in 2012.,There are 15 countries currently known to be endemic for yaws.","Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. The ""yellow"" in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients.,Symptoms of yellow fever include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue.,A small proportion of patients who contract the virus develop severe symptoms and approximately half of those die within 7 to 10 days.,The virus is endemic in tropical areas of Africa and Central and South America.,Large epidemics of yellow fever occur when infected people introduce the virus into heavily populated areas with high mosquito density and  where most people have little or no immunity, due to lack of vaccination. In these conditions, infected mosquitoes of the Aedes aegypti species transmit the virus from person to person.,Yellow fever is prevented by an extremely effective vaccine, which is safe and affordable. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to grant sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease.  A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. The vaccine provides effective immunity within 10 days for 80-100% of people vaccinated, and within 30 days for more than 99% of people vaccinated.,Good supportive treatment in hospitals improves survival rates. There is currently no specific anti-viral drug for yellow fever.,The Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy launched in 2017  is an unprecedented initiative. With more than 50 partners involved, the EYE partnership supports 40 at-risk countries in Africa and the Americas to prevent, detect, and respond to yellow fever suspected cases and outbreaks.
